Conference Room TBD.  

This meeting will be to discuss opportunity for EBS to provide the network

VBN/IPNetConnect application?
Attached is a one page summary on Ross.  Look forward to speaking with you 
this afternoon at 4:15pm.  Thanks.  SR:-)

Last Thursday, I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at 
the power marketer's meeting on the FERC's investigation of the wholesale 
market in the West (and in particular California).  Ellen Wolf (of Tabors 
Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations 
by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made 
the following points:
There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in 
the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would 
hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West 
as well.
High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does 
anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised 
by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still 
incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level 
equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.  
The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by 
scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, 
therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time 
prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund 
as an asset allocation scheme.
The market would function better if more information was provided to the 
market.
The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.
To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, 
you will find there are many "hidden" slides that were not part of the oral 
presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional 
information.

According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot 
more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the 
generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff 
is looking into the data we provided.  

I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to 
Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a 
different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott 
and answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of 
eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be 
able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of 
scarcity .  
 
As you are probably aware, your department has been selected to participate 
in Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In 
preparation for this rollout, it is imperative that we gather information 
about your workstation and the applications you use.  To begin this data 
collection, we have automated the process and your system has just been 
inventoried.   Once this information is received, we will be working with 
your department co-ordinator, Sheri Cromwell, to consolidate this information 
to ensure this transition is as smooth as possible.

The GEM team would like to thank you for your participation.  If you have any 
questions, please call Lee Steele at 713-345-8259.

LETTER FROM COLLEGE

An exact replica of a letter a daughter wrote to her parents
from college

Dear Mom and Dad:

It has now been three months since I left for college. I
have been remiss in writing this and I am very sorry for my
thoughtlessness in not having written before. I
will bring you up to date now, but, before you read on,
please sit down.

YOU ARE NOT TO READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE SITTING DOWN.

OKAY! Well, then, I am getting along pretty well now. The
skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of
the window of my dormitory when it caught
fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I
only get those sick headaches once a day.

Fortunately the fire in the dormitory and my jump were
witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm,
and he was the one who called the fire department
and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and,
since I had nowhere to live because of the burned out
dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share
his apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but
it's kind of cute.

He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and
are planning to be married. We haven't set the exact date
yet, but it will be before my pregnancy
begins to show.

Yes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are
looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will
welcome the baby and give it the love,
devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.

The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my
boyfriend has some minor infection, which prevents us from
passing our pre-marital blood tests, and I
carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with
the penicillin injections I am having daily. I know you will
welcome him into our family with open arms. He is kind and,
although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is
of a different race and religion than ours, I know your
often-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered
by the fact that his skin color is somewhat different from
ours. I am sure you will love him as I do.

His family background is good too, for I am told that his
father is an important gun-bearer in the village from which
he came.

Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you
that there was no dormitory fire, I did not have a
concussion or a skull fracture. I was not in the hospital, I
am not pregnant, I am not engaged. I do not have syphilis
and there is no man in my life.

However, I am getting a 'D' in History and an 'F' in Science
and I wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.

Yours,

Your Loving Daughter.

Sally, Brent and Gary,

In a meeting with Bryan, Jeff, Gary and Markus on Monday, November 20th, I 
showed Bryan a copy of the monthly price verification procedures and the book 
administrator's Price Verification Comparison Spreadsheet .  I also showed 
Brent this information later in the day, as he had to leave before we all 
left.

Therefore, I find Bryan's Operations' bullet  wrong and misleading.  This is 
not the statement that was made and agreed to on Monday when we all met.  
This statement is also not consistent with what is actually in the 
attachment.  You will receive a copy of the price verifcation spreadsheet for 
the last six months on Monday.

Please call me or Theresa with questions.

Subject: Debt Trading Losses

Bryan,
I think the second bullet is misleading.  The bullet is not reflective of 
what is actually stated in the attached document.
There is a month-end price verification process on the Credit book.  
Trader pricing is compared to prime broker pricing.  Where the mark is 
greater that 2 points, the difference is discussed with the trader.  Trader 
must then amend the mark or provide third party substantiation for the 
illiquid position.
The Price Verifiaction Comparison Spreadsheet with broker quotes is filed and 
maintained by Risk Management.

The Operations break-down in the process relates to:
 Triplets excluded from the monthly price verification process and not 
escalated, prioritized to management
 Telewest  pricing relied on a price from the prime broker which was manually 
sourced and not current
 Price Verification Comparison results should be formalized and distributed 
to senior management.

Thanks. Sheila

Subject: Debt Trading Losses


We have discovered two positions in the Debt Trading book which were not 
being marked to market. The current mark of the 2 positions results in 
approximately $4.7 million loss.  The details are in :



The primary control issues are:
? Trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements
? Operations did not perform monthly price verification processes
? Desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had 
not moved over the term of the transactions (Q1 '00 - Nov 15th)

The losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by 
Operations.  The trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will 
implement the steps agreed with Operations to ensure that we have a robust 
approach to controls for the Debt Trading book going forward.

Hi Larry,

Thanks for completing the diamond information request form at 
http://www.DSOURCEVA.com

I did a preliminary search and found the following diamonds for you to 
consider.  There were many extremely nice diamonds at prices substantially 
below your budget so I have include a longer recommendation list than usual.  
This selection should help you determine what is the best value for you.

We filter out the 80 to 90% of diamonds that are cut poorly and only present 
to our customers diamonds that have great cut because we know that cut is the 
primary factor in a diamond's beauty, especially sparkle and fire.

With a round diamond, millimeter measurements are more important than the 
actual carat weight with regard to appearance. More carat weight does not 
necessarily mean more size.  For example, diamonds with depth percentages 
less than 60% will generally have a larger diameter, for the same carat 
weight, than those with depth percentages greater than 60% even though both 
diamonds could be ideal cut.  While we search for diamonds in the top cut 
classes, the preferred combination of depth and table percentages is a matter 
of personal taste and choice.  The three measurement numbers are the longest 
diameter, shortest diameter, and depth in millimeters.  The three letter 
codes after the measurement numbers are the Polish, Symmetry and Fluorescence 
ratings.

Prices in parenthesis are cash discount prices for wire transfers that are 3% 
reduction from credit card prices.  We need to check certification to assess 
specifications marked with ? below.

Diamond #1
RD, 1.31 carat, AGS cert, F color, VS2 clarity, price $10,209 ($9903), depth 
61.2%, table 57%, measurements 7.08 x 7.04 x 4.32 mm, ID ID Inert (Triple 
Ideal cut)

Diamond #2

depth 58.6%, table 59%, measurements 7.14 x 7.12 x 4.18 mm, VG VG N

Diamond #3

depth 61.9%, table 55%, measurements 7.30 x 7.40 x 4.55 mm, VG G N

I've given you a little variety to consider because you need to decide on 
what your priorities are for the right diamond for you.

Which of these diamonds would you like us to order in for inspection?  If 
none of these is what you are looking for, what is it that you would like to 
see different?  The more feedback you can give us, the more effective we can 
be at finding the diamond of your dreams.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

These diamonds were available as of Monday and we have copies of the 
certifications that we can share with you via email at your request.  High 
quality, well cut diamonds like these do not stay on the market long.  If you 
are interested in one of these diamonds, please let us know quickly so we can 
request the wholesaler put it on hold for us.

If you are looking for a really spectacular mounting, check out our favorite 
manufacturer's online catalog at http://www.18karati.com where you can click 
on Catalog then click on Wedding Rings to see pictures of some of the best 
craftsmanship in the industry.  This is a manufacturer's web site so there 
are no prices listed.  If you see something you like, give us the item 
numbers and we will get price quotes that are a fraction of regular retail 
prices.  Our customers have been thrilled with the quality and beauty of 
these mountings so we can highly recommend them to you.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!
As you are aware, your business unit has been selected to participate in 
Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In

questions, please contact Jose Favela at (713)345-5878.
David,

I think this point is moot for the time being because (as of last Tuesday) we 
are not dealing with Bidder D.

I think it is ok legally to go this way -- although there is potential 
liability under the WARN Act (the plant closing law).  We probably can 
schedule around that exposure, though, by giving everyone who possibly may be 
affected 60 days' notice. 

Practically, however, this would not be my favorite approach.  I'd prefer it 
if we could have the ability to compete for top performers, but we should be 
able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and 
present for possible hiring by the buyer.  

I would like more information about what is meant by "ENA does not interfere 
with" the offers made by the buyer.  Does that mean no counteroffers? 

To answer the question of whether we can bind all of Enron, I would say that 
it is unlikely, unless we want to ask.  It is easier to commit only the 
wholesale group, rather than ask Corp., EES, Broadband, etc.  whether they 
will abide by the agreement, so I would recommend limiting it to that group, 
if possible.  We may be able to include the pipelines, given that they have 
been involved in this transaction.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Michelle

Subject: Triple Lutz Employee Matters

With respect to bidder D we are being asked not to compete with them for 
those employees they would like to hire.  i.e. we have to sever them and 
bidder D gets to hire them if they want to (in which case the severed 
employees get no severance payment if they turn DFS down).  I would like to 
propose something like the following:

 1.  We provide Bidder D with a list of all Designated Employees, their 
position, historical compensation.
 2.  Bidder D covenants to make offers to ___% of certain pools of Designated 
Employees e.g. commercial, operations, engineering, trading, etc.
 3.  Bidder D covenants to make offers that will not allow Designated 
Employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance 
plan.
 4.  Between signing and closing, Bidder D provide us with a list of Offerees 
- Designated Employees to whom Bidder D intends to make offers of    
employment.
 5.  ENA covenants that we will not interfere with Bidder D's offers (can we 
bind all of Enron?).
 6.  If an Offeree turns down the offer (in writing) then ENA is free to 
continue to employee Offeree.  However, if we do not continue to employ the 
Offeree, no   severance is owed.
 
The intent of the above is to encourage Offerees to take the offers - they 
give up severance rights if they don't - but provide us the opportunity to 
continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we 
want to keep.  Also it caps our severance obligation by requiring Bidder D to 
specify how many offers must be made.  Bidder D is certain to want more than 
this but I am uncomfortable saying we can't continue to employee any of the 
Offerees.

Please advise.




In light of the challenges being offered by the Ergonomics Standard and to 
ensure that each group within Enron understands the importance of the 
Grandfather requirements, we have scheduled a meeting on Thursday, November 
30, at 1 PM CST. Those of you who will be in Houston can get together in the 
Crisis Center (EB4554) and others can join in the meeting via conference call 
at 877 795-3687, Access Code 539773. Russ has told me the meeting may last an 
hour, depending on questions. He has also informed me that prior to our 
meeting we should all read the document attached in his memo below.

Thanks in advance for your participation.

Subject: Revisions to Office Ergonomics Program Draft

Attached is the promised revisions to the last draft of the Office Ergonomics 
Program to bring it in line with the OSHA final rule for Grandfathering. As 
reports place each of you in different phases of modification of the last 
draft, I have left the corrections and additions in red so that you may 
easily see the areas needing changes. All are considered required changes 
except:

*The time to retain ergo related records other than program evaluations is 
not set under the Grandfather requirements. Most will want to know how long 
to keep records, and so this is established herein, but you may wish to 
modify the times.

*Appendix II and III is not required unless you do not Grandfather, but may 
be used anyway if you so desire. As some have not established a decision on 
Grandfathering, these attachments have been included in case they are needed. 
If used, you will need to fill in the name and phone number on the where to 
report MSD work related injuries in Appendix II. I can do this for you if you 
supply the name and number and desire or intend to distribute the appendixes 
in digital form.

Note that this version is set up for use by the Enron EH&S Group for Houston 
office employees, and should not be used without making the revisions to 
reflect your company operations and internal organization in the respective 
places in the text. Implementation does not mean you have to have completed 
all the requirements in the written program. You will have 11 months from 
November 14, 2000 to accomplish that, new hires notwithstanding. The final 
rule Preamble allows modifications until Jan. 16, 2001 for programs 
implemented prior to Nov. 14, 2000.

This is a written program intended for Grandfathering under 29 CFR 
1910.900(c), and if used as a written plan to meet other requirements of this 
Standard will need additional modification.

We are waiting on legal review by an outside attorney on some areas of the 
final rule which should be available in about a week. A Safety Notice will 
then be issued on this final rule. A revised compliance draft for the 
Field/Plant written program will be issued next week.

Regards,

Russ

Given tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch resources to make

postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust this meets with 
your approval and thanks for all the hard work.

Subject: Topics for General Counsel Off-site

Jim, the following is in response to your request that we forward to you our 
suggested topics for the General Counsel offsite on April 4&5. 
 1. Outside Counsel
      - Who are the top firms we are using?
      -Should there be a data base for firms we are using(and particular 
attorneys in the firm)and for what.
      -Could/should the data base include info on fees paid to firms in the 
previous year so we know who the top firms are and also so we have an idea 
how much we pay in legal fees on an Enron wide basis.
     -What position do we take on probable fee increases toi cover the 
tremendous salary increases that firms recently gave to their associates?

 2.Legal Web Page
 Should we develop a Legal Group web page that has some of the info mentioned 
immediately above. We could also use this to pass on info re vacancies, 
announcements of new hires. This could also have a short bio on each attorney 
including in particular any particular expertise that the attorney may have 
so if someone has a question on swaps or Hart Scott or DOT regulations you 
could look inhouse first for answers to questions rather than picking up the 
phone and calling outside counsel for the answer to simple questions.

 3.Summer Clerks
 Should we have a centralized program for summer clerks?
 
 4. Recruiting
 Should we try to somewhat centralize this process or at a minimum set up a 
mechanism for letting the various groups know of good candidates that have 
been interviewed but not hired because of too many strong candidates for 1 
position.

 5. Management Succession
 I think we should develop a process for identifying/evaluating individuals 
who currently possess( or with some specific development could possess) the 
capability of moving into the "management " ranks of the legal function Enron 
wide. Thus when a vacancy does occur we have an idea of who are the persons 
who merit consideration from across the corporation to help ensure we are 
getting the best person for the job.

 6. One Enron- since the corporate theme is "one Enron" what can or should we 
be doing to make sure that happens.

Jeff:

Thanks for the raise!  No telling how long HR will take!

The GISB working session was as exciting as you would expect it to be.  Most 
of the early termination and alternative damages provision concepts were 
hammered out.  A law firm (Shook & Shook) volunteered to draft language for 
the concepts agreed to in time for next Friday's committee meeting.  There 
was lot of discussion of what is going on in California and how the early 
termination process should work.  Enron should be fine with all of the 
concepts except the law firm was pushing an extremely broad set off right.  I 
don't think that is will go cross affiliates but it will go across 
contracts.  We will have to see the actual words.  I will attend the next 
meeting most likely by phone.  Hope things are going well.  See you in 13 
days.

Stacy

Subject: Enron Tag Line Change

Dear Enron Employees:

 With the addition of communications to our core businesses, it is 
appropriate for us to modify our existing tag line to simply "Endless 
possibilities."  This change is effective immediately and replaces our 
current tag line of "Natural gas. Electricity. Endless possibilities."

 To achieve our goal of a unified Enron brand, each employee has the 
responsibility to make the Enron image a consistent and strong identity.  
This is partially accomplished through correct application of the logo and 
tag line.  A revised Corporate Identity Guidelines Book has been developed to 
assist you in following the correct standards.  You may obain a copy of this 
new book by completing a Forms Request and ordering Item #42629.    These 
guidelines will also be made available electronically on the Brand Site at 
home.enron.com.

 We'd like to take this opportunity to remind all of you about the importance 
of maintaining a consistent look, especially with our stationery and business 
cards.  It has come to our attention recently that some employees are having 
these items produced by outside vendors and are not following the established 
guidelines.  This must stop immediately.  Please use the internal resources 
available to you for these items.  They will ensure that all guidelines are 
followed correctly and consistently.  If you have questions on how to get 
these items or on the guidelines, you may contact Marge Nadasky in Corporate 
Identity at marge.nadasky@enron.com.

 One name, one company....one Enron.  Our recent reorganization brings us 
another step closer to realizing this goal.  Please make sure you do your 
part to protect and strengthen the Enron brand around the world.

 Thank you for your continued support and cooperation.


      Office of the Chairman

It's not the same as a self evaluation form but I hope you find this 
informative as to my where abouts this year.  I am collecting similar lists

Subject: Virginia Natural Gas...Columbia Gas

Hi Joann and Alvin,

As you know, effective October 1, ENA became agent for Virginia Natural Gas.  
Here in Volume Management, as I try to load beginning balances and actualize 
volumes (so that I can pay VNG's transportation charges) for 10/2000, it 
appears that the following contracts for VNG/Cgas are not in Unify.

Contract Number  Type    
38079    FSS...Master Contract
35889    x-133 LNG Storage
60536    SST
37634    ISS
53004    FSS
60537    FSS

I would appreciate any help you can give me in getting these contracts in 
Unify as soon as possible.  If you have any questions or need additional 
information, please let me know.

Thanks,
Angel









In a memo from Parvis Adib dated Oct. 31 (copy attached), the PUC describes
a serious concern on the part of the Commission regarding market abuse
through relieving Local Congestion under the current Protocols. John Meyer
has asked me to draft a suggested solution to this concern. I am
recommending the following solution and believe it should be very easy to
implement.

THE PROBLEM: Gaming whereby an entity deliberately and chronically places
itself in a situation to create local congestion in order to profit from
instructions to decrement its energy deliveries.

The current language states that when a resource  is instructed to
decrement its energy deliveries and a Market Solution does not exist the
resource's QSE will pay the minimum of the MCPE for that zone or 0. The
trouble with this approach is that if the MCPE is negative the QSE is
rewarded for having a resource causing local congestion. If the situation
persisted over time this could encourage inefficient generation to be built
on the same area so that it can profit by having its output reduced or even
turned off.

Note that this would only happen in a situation where the local congestion
is located within a zone that is also susceptible to CSC congestion as well
and the QSEs in such a zone are decremented most of the time which leads to
high incidence of negative MCPE for the zone. This does not appear likely
but could occur if a zone is relatively small; i.e., dominated by QSEs that
are few in number and that consistently overschedule across a CSC zone with
the anticipation that they will always be instructed to decrement energy in
real time.

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION :

Do not compensate or charge a resource that is instructed to decrement its
energy deliveries by ERCOT when a Market Solution does not exist in
relieving local congestion.  However, the resource must obey the
instruction in order to maintain system reliability.

Please give me your comments on this solution concept  before Dec. 1. I  am
recommending that we add this as an item to vote on at the RUG meeting
scheduled for Dec. 6. I will also draft the recommended language changes
(very minor) to sections 6 and 7 and distribute it prior to the meeting.

I have encountered the following problems calcing at home.

1.  On my Portcalc screen, everything was very tiny.  It worked but I know I 
couldn't copy a post id because I wouldn't be able to see the new number.

2.  I wanted to look at my curves last night and they opened up with errors.  
Basically it's like opening up the curves on a machine without the correct 
drivers.  Seems like we need to put those drivers on the network and maybe 
upgrade it to Oracle 8i too.

3.  I don't know how we can change the printer to print at home.  Only 
concern here is if we are offsite and have a local printer (will we be able 
to put that printer on the network?).  

That's all I can think of right now.

Any suggestions?

Dave

_____________________________________________________________________

June Nasdaq futures closed 26.50 lower at 1808.00 today. Prices hit a
fresh two-week low today, but have been trading sideways for several
weeks. The sideways trading favors the bulls, but they still have
some heavy lifting to do and their next upside objective is
resistance at the key 2,000 area. First support is seen at the 1,732
area.

June S&P 500 futures closed 0.20 higher at 1252.00. Same story:
Prices have leveled off the past four weeks, after rallying solidly
off the early-April low. This does favor the bulls, but not greatly.
Technically, bulls still need to push prices above the 1285
resistance area. My bias is still that any recovery in the stock
market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic, but a slower grind
higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is seen at 1285.00.
First support is seen at 1206.00.

LIVESTOCK: June live cattle closed $0.58 higher at 70.75 today.
Prices rebounded from a technically oversold condition today, and on
news that boxed beef prices had improved. Last week, prices hit a
fresh multi-month low. Still, prices are in an accelerating
two-month-old downtrend on the daily bar chart and bears have
control. Next support, basis June, is seen at $70.25. First
resistance comes in at the $71.00 level.

August feeder cattle closed off 22 cents today at $87.65. The rally
in the corn market today hurt feeders. If recent history continues to
play out in feeders, prices may dip a bit more, but the support area
of 87.40 will cap losses. That is the lower level of the trading band
in place for the past several weeks. If prices break down below the
bottom of the recent trading range, then the door is opened to a
lower trend down to the January low just above the $86.00 level. Next
resistance is seen at $88.00. First support is seen at $87.60 and
then at $87.40.

June lean hogs closed $0.25 higher at $68.80 today. Commercial buying
was seen in the futures pits, reports said. Price action today saw
more consolidation after the strong losses recorded in recent weeks.
But the bears still have the momentum on their side at present. Next
support lies at $67.00. First resistance is located at the 69.50
level.

GRAINS: July corn futures closed 4 1/2 cents higher at $2.01 3/4
today. Another "mini" weather scare popped prices today. Two
important things to point out here: One, July corn (now the nearby
contract) did not stay below the key $2.00-per-bushel level very
long. Secondly, notice how even some hot temps forecast for mid-May
popped prices higher. I suspect that with prices this low going into
the growing season, this type of knee-jerk reaction to any changes in
the weather patterns will be the norm. Still, bottom pickers should
beware. Next resistance is now seen at $2.04. Next support is seen at
$2.00.

July soybeans closed 7 1/2 cents higher at $4.43 1/4 today. Like
corn, beans were boosted by a "mini" weather scare and ideas that now
there may not be significant corn acres switched to soybeans.
Importantly, the bean market did not fare that badly, technically,
last week, in the face of the sell offs in corn and wheat futures.
Today's big upside push propelled prices to a fresh five-week high
and pushed prices above a stiff resistance area at $4.45. Bears still
have the advantage. It's going to take a "significant" weather scare
this spring or summer to force soybean prices solidly higher. First
resistance is now seen at the $4.50 area and then $4.55. First
support is now seen at $4.35.

July soybean meal closed up $3.60 at $159.40 today. Prices today
pushed to a fresh nearly three-month-high. Importantly, prices pushed
above the congestion area on the

daily bar chart that had contained gains for better than a week.
Recent price action is very encouraging to the bulls and is a solid
sign the lows are in place in the meal market. Next resistance comes
in at the $162.00 area. First support is seen at $156.00.

July bean oil closed 7 points higher at 14.73 cents today. Prices
scored another new contract low today of 14.62 cents. Oil is still
technically weaker than beans or meal right now. But I would be
surprised if there is much downside left in oil. Next resistance
comes in at 15.00 cents. Next support is seen at 14.50 cents.

July Chicago wheat gapped higher on the daily bar chart and closed 7
1/4 cents higher at $2.78 1/2 today. Hot and dry weather forecast for
the U.S. Plains states this week combined with a bullish USDA report
last Thursday to send prices sharply higher today. Now, odds have
increased that a double-bottom reversal on the daily bar chart will
be confirmed. The fact that wheat was technically oversold also led
to the stronger upside movement today. Prices last Wednesday touched
the contract low of $2.65. Bears still have the slight edge, but
bulls are gaining confidence rapidly. First resistance lies at the
$2.80 area. Next support is seen at $2.75.

SOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 9 points lower at 9.01 cents today.
Prices scored a bearish "outside day" down on the daily bar chart
today. We still could see a minor bullish pennant forming in sugar,
but prices would need to bounce right back higher soon. Bulls can
still correctly argue that today's pullback was just consolidation
amid good prices gains seen recently. A three-month high was scored
in July sugar just recently. A six-week-old uptrend line is still in
place on the daily bar chart. Next resistance now comes in at 9.15
cents--today's high. First support is seen at 8.80 cents.

July N.Y. coffee closed 3.40 cents lower at 64.25 cents today. Prices
gapped lower on the daily bar chart and let some of the air out of
the bulls' balloon. They had gained momentum lately. Not much
technical damage will occur if prices can rebound, but if good
follow-through selling occurs Tuesday, then odds significantly
increase that prices will test the recent lows. First support comes
in at 62 cents. First resistance is seen at 67.00 cents-- today's
high.

July N.Y. cocoa closed $10 higher today, at $1,024. Prices scored a
corrective "inside day" on the daily bar chart today, following
Friday's big sell off. The bears wanted to see follow-through selling
today to confirm a bearish key reversal down on the daily bar chart,
but that did not occur. Bulls and bears are still on a level playing
field. Next resistance comes in at $1,062. First support is now seen
at $1,000.

July cotton closed 153 points higher at 46.70 cents today. Hot and
dry weather in the cotton-growing regions of the U.S. combined with a
technically oversold condition on the market to push prices solidly
higher today. The cotton market will be like the grains. Prices are
so depressed that traders will be extra jumpy when any potentially
adverse weather patterns are forecast. There was good follow-through
buying today from Friday's "outside day" up on the daily bar chart,
and a key reversal up was confirmed. This gives the bulls a bit more
confidence. Cotton is still in a bear market and any rebounds may be
selling opportunities for the bears. Let's see what happens this
week. My bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming
process. Next resistance lies at 48.00 cents. First support now is
seen around 45.00 cents. Would-be bottom-pickers should still beware.

July orange juice futures closed 30 points higher today, at 79.20
cents. Prices closed near the session high. Last week, bulls filled
an important downside gap area on the daily bar chart. They have
gained confidence after the recent price action, but will need to see
more upside action this week--pushing prices above 80 cents--to gain
solid momentum. Next resistance is seen at 80.00 cents. Next support
comes in at 77.60 cents--today's low.

July lumber futures closed the limit of $10.00 higher again today, at
$324.80. Prices today again gapped higher and hit a new for-the-move
high. Bulls are really snorting now. Expect more volatility, as is
typical for this market. The next upside objective for the bulls is
now the $330.00 area, and then $335.00. First support is seen at the
$315.00 area. This is a fun market to watch from the sidelines. But
the volatility can be a killer to those who are caught on the wrong
side of the lumber market.

METALS: June COMEX gold closed up $0.40 today, at $268.70. Prices
corrected a bit more today after last Wednesday's strong gains that
pushed prices to a two-month high. This market is in a nice uptrend
since scoring its early-April low. Recent price action is what bulls
needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on the chart. Next
resistance is located at $271.10--the recent high. First support is
seen at $266.00.

July silver closed up $0.02 today, at $4.357 an ounce. Same story:
Silver prices are not that far above the contract low. Prices are
chopping at lower levels, and this suggests a "basing" action that
many markets need to change the trend from down, to sideways, to
eventually up. Next support is seen at $4.30. First resistance is
seen at $4.425. Bears have the advantage.

July N.Y. copper closed 85 points lower today, at 75.50 cents. A
bearish U.S. economic report today pulled copper prices down to a new
contract low. The stock market and the U.S. economy will have to be
healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper.
Next resistance is seen at 77.00 cents. Next support is seen at 75.00
cents.

ENERGIES: July crude closed $0.06 higher at $29.13 today. Bulls and
bears are still at a stand-off, but bulls will gain the edge on a
move above $29.50. Expect more choppy trading. Next support is seen
at 28.00. Next resistance lies at $29.50.

July heating oil closed 86 points lower today, at .7566. Bulls still
have the slight edge. Look for more choppy trading in the near
future. Next support is seen at 74.00 cents. Next resistance is seen
at 78.00 cents.

July unleaded gasoline closed 302 points lower at .9428 today. After
prices scored a new contract high last week, they have sold off
dramatically. The increase in volatility at higher price levels
suggests a topping process in the market. Bulls have lost their edge.
Next support is seen at $.9200. First resistance is seen at $.9600.

July natural gas closed 11.5 cents higher at $4.465 today. After,
prices hit a fresh five-and-one-half-month low last Wednesday, we've
seen corrective consolidation. Bears still have the edge. Next
support is seen at $4.20 and first resistance is at $4.60.

STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 20
points lower at .8740 today. Prices pushed to another fresh four-week
low today. Bears have the edge. My bias is still that there is not
much downside left in the Euro, but the markets are always right, so
we'll see. Next support is now seen at .8700. Next resistance is seen
at .8850.

The June Japanese yen closed 47 points lower at .8143 today. Bears
are in control. Bulls are hoping for some "basing" activity at lower
levels, and that may be occurring, although it's too early to tell.
Next support now lies at the .8100 level. First resistance is seen at
the .8326 level.

The June Swiss franc closed 10 points lower at .5713. Bears are in
command. Prices pushed to a fresh 5.5-month low today, and took out
the mid-April low of .5702. If we see follow-through selling to push
prices significantly below today's low, that a bearish signal and
portends significantly more downside. A 4.5-month-old downtrend line
is in place on the daily bar chart, and it has accelerated recently.
Next support is seen at the .5700 level. First resistance comes in at
the .5800 level.

The June Australian dollar futures closed 22 points lower at .5193
today. Prices pushed to a fresh two-month high last Thursday and the
bulls have the advantage as a six- week-old uptrend line is in place
on the daily bar chart. First resistance is now seen at .5300. First
support is now seen at .5150.

The June Canadian dollar closed 4 points lower today, at .6444. Bulls
are losing momentum as prices correct from the push to the May high.
They still have the slight edge, on a short-term basis, but they will
lose it if they can't turn prices at least sideways this week. This
currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there
is much more downside. Next resistance is seen at the .6500 level.
First support is seen at the .6400 level.

The June British pound closed 4 points lower at 1.4182. Trading
continues choppy at lower levels. As prices approach the lower
portion of the recent trading range, strong support should kick in
and provide for a bounce. But if prices fall below the early April
low of 1.4112, then the door is open to much steeper losses. This
currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not
think there is much more downside in the sterling. One could still
argue that price action the past few weeks has been a "basing" before
prices eventually turn north. A move below 1.4100 would be considered
a bearish downside breakout. Next support is now seen at the 1.4112
level. Next resistance comes in at the 1.4270 level.

The June U.S. dollar index closed 24 points higher at 117.22 today.
Prices also pushed to a fresh four-week high again today. Next
resistance lies at the 117.70 level. First support is seen at the
115.50 area. My bias is still that there is not much upside left in
the dollar index. But this week technical odds have increased that a
new high will be scored. We'll see. Markets are never wrong--
analysts are.

June U.S. T-bonds closed 14/32 higher today at 99 20/32. Prices
scored a corrective "inside day" today after Friday's price crash to
a six-month low. All eyes are on this week's FOMC meeting, at which a
decision will be made on whether or not to cut interest rates.
Trading will likely be subdued up to the time of the announcement,
which is set to occur tomorrow afternoon. Short-term indicators show
the market is still overdone on the downside, but nobody should stand
in front of a steaming locomotive. Longer-term charts do show good
support at the 99 even area. First resistance is now seen at 100
even-- or "par."

The June U.S. T-note closed up 12.0 (32nds) today at 103.11.0. Prices
scored a corrective "inside day" after crashing to a five-month low
Friday. Bears have the edge now, as severe technical damage has been
inflicted this week. First support is seen at the 102.29.0 level.
First resistance is seen at 103.16.0 area.

Based on the attached, NBP is extremely cheap!  While the level of required 
premium over the current market price to buy back the shares is difficult to 
determine, I wonder why we wouldn't take a hard look at buying Duke's units 
(at no premium).  I see basically two paths:  First, a strategic investment 
made in contemplation of buying the remainder of the NBP units back 
(presumably at a premium over current prices)  and then contributing the NBP 
investment into the new regulated entity structure (at higher values).   
Second, at these prices the investment in NBP units compares favorably to 
other acquisitions GPG is looking at, e.g. East Tennessee.  Even if the 
contribution to the new entity doesn't occur, GPG could hold the Duke units 
for an indefinite time period, report reasonably good incremental earnings 
and cash flow and sell them back to the public at an opportunistic level.   
What do you think?

Subject: Sta. 20 Suction Pressures

Darrell,  Attached is a history (last 365 days) of the suction pressures of 
Station 20 arranged in descending order.  In a nutshell, we looked at the 
minimum pressure (492 psig), calculated the pressure drop (34# at 54.4 
MMcf/d) on the proposed 6.6 miles of 12" to get 458 psig at the upstream side 
of the regulator.  Typically we would like to have a 50# differental across 
the regulator, which would give us 408 psig downstream of regulation.  I 
believe you were needing 435 psig.

 

Looking at the it in reverse, 435 psig + 50 psig across reg =  485 psig, 
calculate pressure drop (31 psig), we would need 516 psig at the suction of 
Station 20.  Note there are only 8 days during the last year where the 
pressure was lower than 516 psig or 97.8% of the time.

Please call me if you would like to discuss further or would like to meet.

Stan,

Thanks for your email and we may take you up on your offer to help at some
point.

Also, I'm glad you let me know that you/Enron are interested in investment
opportunities.  My investment focus is exclusively on business-to-business
e-commerce and technology companies which are currently pretty good places
to invest.  We will be raising a new fund hopefully next year...I'll keep
you posted.  Also, I come across attractive early stage deals which our fund
is not set up to handle.  When I do, I set up an LLC and get some people to
kick in (Frevert and Rice came in on the last deal), so if that is of
interest I'll keep you in mind.

Talk to you soon,

Dave

Sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today

The bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the California 
Assembly.  The Republicans are currently in caucus until 3:30 PST and then 
will go to the floor for a vote.  The current situation is very fluid, but 
sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote, 
lacking the two-thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance.  If this is the 
case, the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be 
forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans.  Absent of last minute 
financial rescues by Davis or a new longer bridge loan package (unlikely) 
Socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy.  The main problem would then be the 
waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission 
line purchase or other assistance.

There is an outside chance that Republican defectors could precipitate from 
the current caucus.  There is extreme pressure on the Republicans from Davis 
and Angelides.  If the bill failed due to lack of Republican support, it 
would provide Davis the opportunity to blame Republicans for on-going 
expenditures of $70M/day (power purchases), and a possible bankruptcy by 
Socal.  The last Republican who gave support to a democratic bill (AB 1X), 
Representative Bill Campbell, lost his job.  Sources also confirm that 
Democrats have not met with Republicans on the bond issuance since last week.

Marketplace Meditations
by Os Hillman

Being an Overcomer

I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have peace.
In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have
overcome the world.
- (John 16:33)


"Why does it seem that those involved in Christian enterprise
find the way so hard? It seems as though it is harder for those
who are committed Christians in business. Have you found this to
be true?" This was the comment from a business associate
recently. My answer was a definite yes. In fact, if you were not
a Christian and sought to do a similar business without regard to
maintaining a biblical philosophy, the way would be much smoother
sailing. It makes us think of the prophet who asked, "Why do the
wicked prosper?" (see Jer. 12:1)

It is a spiritual principle of which we speak. When the
Israelites crossed the Jordan before they entered the Promised
Land, they fought only two battles. Then after they entered the
Promised Land, they fought 39 battles. The way of the cross is
not paved with lilies; it is paved with grace. When we seek to
honor God in our business life, we will be met with opposition
from the spiritual forces of this world. This is why each of us
must commit ourselves to walking in the power of the Holy Spirit
and to be as gentle as doves but as wise as serpents.

Do not be surprised when you find the way harder as a believer
than when you were a non-believer. You now have more at stake
among the spiritual forces that desire you to be defeated and
ineffective.

Stand firm against the evil forces that desire to keep you from
walking in freedom in the Promised Land. Jesus is your victory
for every battle you will encounter. Call on His name.

Subject: Good reference to plan a trip to Thailand

I remember you mentioned that you and your friends were planning a trip.  
This website is offered by the Tourism Authority of Thailand.  I took a look 
at it, and thought that it was good.  I would even use it to lure my 
boyfriend to visit home with me next year.

Mary Nell: I just wanted to tell how happy I am that all went well with JC's 
surgery. I do believe in miracles. I also wanted to relay to you something 
that I wanted to tell you awhile back, but I never did. Through all the 
difficult times that have taken place, you have been a true inspiration to 
me. I have absolutely no idea what you were going through but I tried many 
time to place myself in your shoes, and realized that the question I would 
most want answered is why. I then thought how I would react to not recieving 
an answer to this question and have concluded that  .

Good News,

The ISDA has been approved and will be signed when the CEO return from 
holydays (Jan 8). They will sign the 2 ISDA's we sent for Gas Natural Mexico 
and Comercializadora Metrogas, and also want to sign another for Gas Natural 
Servicios.

They will send me the corporate documents for this company, I will forward 
them as soon as I receive them.

Paul, please tell us if we can use the same format of ISDA as in 
Comercializadora Metrogas, they are going to provide the same guaranty from 
Gas Natural Mexico.

Regards,

Agustin Perez

Dear Debra,

The measurements for 005 are 16" for the necklace and 7 1/2" for the jacla,  
006
is 15 1/2" for the necklace and 5" for the jacla, and the internet necklace
measures 13" and 7" for the jacla.  Also included is a necklace that you might
be interested in.  It matches up very well and the jacla has spiny oster on 
the
tip.  It has a price of $425 and measures 15 1/2" and 7" for jacla.

003,004 (air 5)

Thank you,
Richardson's Trading Company

New Market Opportunity:  Industrial Hourly Sales

I was wondering if it made sense to discuss internal to Enron Government=20
Affairs the concept of opening the Large Industrial Market to eCommerce.  I=
f=20
we think this is reasonable, maybe we can make a pitch to the Enron NetWork=
s.

It is my recollection that the current regulatory rules related to customer=
=20
switching and marketer enrollment do not allow large consumers to buy energ=
y=20
on a less than monthly basis - there is no switching within the month.  LDC=
s=20
have historically prohibitied this to make sure that they were "paid" and=
=20
energy flows were in "balance".

To me, this regulatory "restriction" makes no sense at all.  First, big=20
consumers have the capability to buy energy hourly - staff and resources. =
=20
Second, big consumers need to be sure that they are getting the absolute=20
lowest price.  Third, big consumers control the load which if proper price=
=20
signals are provided can be used to reduce overall system peaks.  Finally,=
=20
the LDC arguments have always been ridiculous - they buy and sell energy=20
hourly.

To initiate this discussion, I was wondering if Jeff Dasovich and Lisa Yoho=
=20
could find out in CA and PA, respectively, if I am correct about the=20
regulatory "restrictions".  The other question, for Jeff Brown, is whether =
or=20
not we could construct a framework for Enron Online that provides for the=
=20
purchasing of the large customer full requirements (for example, metering,=
=20
data needs, etc.).

Does this make sense to everyone?  If I am way out in left field, let's not=
=20
do alot of work.  It just seems to me that we should try to migrate big=20
consumer load to Enron Online before competitors get into eCommerce.

Subject: Enron Net Works


It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha=
ve=20
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad=
=20
array of industries.  Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major=
=20
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries. =
=20
EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, w=
e=20
have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of ov=
er=20
$25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.

We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very=
=20
specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for=20
transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20
site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se=
ll=20
at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi=
cal=20
eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any,=20
competitors that can provide this capability.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are=
=20
correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro=
n.

Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20
opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net=20
Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a=
=20
broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately=
=20
be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,=20
wholesale, retail and broadband services.

Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along=
=20
with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. =20
Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff=20
services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support=
=20
services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and=20
success.  To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these=
=20
new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan=
t=20
functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadban=
d.

Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mi=
ke=20
McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial=20
Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for=20
Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. =20
Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron=20
North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron=01,s Executive=20
Committee.

Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net=20
Works.  It will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did =
as=20
an Enron global function.  Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology=
=20
Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the=20
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms.

EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now=
=20
be a part of Enron Net Works.  The success of EnronOnLine enables us to=20
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets. In addition, the=

current eCommerce initiatives: Harry Arora, Public Financial Securities; Ja=

Over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational=20

Wanted to take a minute to thank each of you for your assistance during our 
preparation for the Wholesale Services portion of yesterday's First Quarter 
Earnings Release conference call and today's First Quarter Update in New York.

February 10, 1999

I am wakened by the approaching chatter of the early morning call to
prayer (sounding a bit like the fuss made by one of those cartoon balls
of fighting dogs and cats).  From the minarets of far away mosques, the
muezzins' cries ricochet through Istanbul's still dark alleys and
streets.  Seagulls, who have drifted up the hill from the Golden Horn,
squawk contentedly outside my window.  From somewhere down below, a
miserable dog joins into the pre-dawn ruckus, soon followed by the local
muezzin, whose amplified singing drowns out all the rest.  He reminds us
that God is great and that prayer is a whole lot more important than
sleep (at least that's what I've been told; he sings in Arabic).
Because my religion thinks more highly of sleep, I feel free to simply
listen, while gently trying to pull the warm blanket of sleep back over
me.  The  muezzin has a beautiful voice.  Its rise and fall stitches
itself into the edges of a dream (in which a former best friend and I
argue about the rules of a game of miniature golf) hanging just out of
reach.

Slowly, the banal calculations that fill my days begin to crowd their
way into my head.  It's about a quarter to six, I figure, which means
there's time for a bit of writing, or even Turkish vocabulary, before I
douse myself in the shower to full consciousness.  I remind myself of
the theory that one can write most freely while still intoxicated with
sleep (or just plain intoxicated), am immediately stricken with the fear
I am incapable of such freedom, take a look round my brain for something
worth writing about (find nothing), hypothesize about the advantages of
a quick dash into the hallway to turn on the gas heater (so that when I
really get up it will be reasonably warm out there), wonder if I really
do have enough stuff prepared to fill up the two hours of my English
lesson with Suleyman, conclude that all this thinking has probably made
any more sleep impossible, then (I realize later) fall back to sleep.

                               *     *     *

My new phone [(212) 292-6486] is hooked up and I have a new internet
server, which will make it much easier to keep in touch.  Hope to attack
that backlog of responses that are due.

Keep in touch.

TCPL intends to seek an interim 2001 Eastern Zone toll of CDN$1.1462/GJ 
starting January 1/01.   This is a 13.6% increase.  They are saying to avoid 
protracted litigation over interim tolls they are only seeking an increase to 
reflect non-renewals and current costs, ROE, capital structure and 
depreciation .  This is not what they intend to seek as a final toll which 
will likely be significantly higher. 

In order to ensure TCPL's position is clear, Garry Mihaichuk, TCPL Exec VP 
for Operations will be attending tomorrow afternoon's briefing on their  
upcoming toll application and pitch their argument to continue negotiations.

Details of their proposed interim tolls are attached.

Thanks for the link.  Sounds like they are doing well.  I'm sure that it is 
due to our analysis and advice.

I assume Mary has had her baby?  How is everything?

As for deer hunting,  it's been really exciting as we've been seeing lots of 
young and middle aged bucks and a bumper crop of fawns for the first time in 
my memory of over 15 years of hunting there.  I have not taken anythin but 
our hunters have gotten a 9, 10 and 11 point.  The 10 point grossed 135 B&C 
swhich is not giant but a darn respectable deer anywhere in the US and outr 
third largest ever.  (For calibration, mine grossed 166). I have one good 8 
point that's about 18" wide and 4.5 yeears old but I may let Weldon shoot him 
as he has not gotten a deer there in 6 years of hunting.  I'm still open to 
you going there to take pictures.  It may be hard to schedule but I really 
would not mind if you wanted to go down there and  tkae some pics on your 
own.  I've got one blind at which the feeders are close and the deer move 
nearly all day.  You could drive down for the day and easily snap some good 
photos from sunup to sundown or from noon to sundown, whatever.  Call me at 
281-807-6802 if you are interested and we can work it out.

Melissa and Hunter are doing well.  He's 4 now and will start pre-school next 
year.  We may have another one on the way but we're not sure yet.

Enron is great and everything I hoped for really.  I will be rotating as 
scheduled to a new role in Feb/Mar.  How are things at Dell?
